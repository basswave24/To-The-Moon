# About
I created this game following a unity course tutorial, while also adding my little spin on things. Further down the line, I have redesigned this project so obstacles can move to the beat of the music, as part of my Object Oriented Programming 2 Module assignment in Second Year.

# Gameplay

# Description
• Project was created using C# and Unity <br/>
• Short game where the objective is to manoeuvre the rocket to dodge the obstacles and reach the
green platform for every level <br/>
• Obstacles react to the background music by getting bigger/smaller and changing colour to the beat
of the music <br/>

# Controls
A - Pivot left  
D - Pivot right  
Spacebar - Thrust  

# How to make it run
Download all the files in the "Game" folder and then press ToTheMoon.exe .<br/> It should work on all resolutions, although I have tested it on 1600x900.<br/>
Alternatively, open project in Unity and just press play.

# What I am most proud of in the assignment
I loved designing the levels and chosing the music. I feel like the music really goes well with the obstacle selection. Designing the levels was really fun because I tried to make it as unique as possible. I also enjoyed learning OOP concepts and incorporating them into something I can actually see (eg: Rocket object)

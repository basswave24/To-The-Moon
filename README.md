# Description
This is a small game where you take control of a rocket and you try to reach the green platform on every level while dodging all the obstacles.   
The levels get more and more intense as you progress. There are also game objects that react to music in the game. They get more and more trippy as the levels progress.  
Headphones are hugely recommended.  

# Controls
A - Pivot left  
D - Pivot right  
Spacebar - Thrust  

# How to make it run
Download all the files in the "Game" folder and then press ToTheMoon.exe . It should work on all resolutions, although I have tested it on 1600x900.
Alternatively, open project in Unity and just press play.
Headphones are recommended to truly appreciate the music.

# What I am most proud of in the assignment
I loved designing the levels and chosing the music. I feel like the music really goes well with the obstacle selection. Designing the levels was really fun because I tried to make it as unique as possible.
I enjoy how all the levels turned out to be and the levels of intensity and tripiness between each level.
